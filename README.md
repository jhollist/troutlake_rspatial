## Trout Lake Station 
### July 17, 2019

This repository contains the materials used in a mini-workshop about spatial 
data handling in R.  The focus of this workshop is to introduce the primary 
packages used for spatial data handling in R as well as discuss several 
limnology-relevant packages.  We will work through a couple of demonstrations
together to get a little bit of hands-on experience.

Schedule for the mini-workshop is below:
